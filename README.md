repo for azure functions sample 

1. [Function to get last modified blob name in blob container](https://github.com/taeyo/AzureFuncs/tree/master/ssgHdfDemo)
    - need to add storage account key with name, "AzureStorage" to application settings 
    - it does not work with Azure Functions 2.x(.net core 2.0)
        - I think there are some issues with Azure Storage SDK now. but, possible to work in neat future.
    - so, please use Azure Function 1.x
